# Observability runbook

Namuh Send emits an AWS-first observability baseline for the email accept and delivery flow. The implementation uses structured JSON logs, W3C/OpenTelemetry-compatible `traceparent` propagation, and CloudWatch Embedded Metric Format (EMF) records so the same application logs can drive CloudWatch Logs and Metrics.

## Telemetry model

Every instrumented request/job has:

- `correlation_id` — stable identifier for support/debugging. API callers can provide `x-correlation-id`; otherwise Namuh Send derives one from the trace id.
- `trace_id`, `span_id`, `parent_span_id`, `traceparent`, `tracestate` — W3C trace context fields that keep API, SQS, worker, SES, and webhook jobs connected.
- `event` — machine-readable log event such as `email.accepted`, `queue.publish`, `worker.email.send`, or `ses.event.received`.
- low-cardinality metric dimensions only: `Service`, `Operation`, `Outcome`, `JobType`, and `EventType`.

The API response for `POST /api/emails` and `POST /api/emails/batch` includes `x-correlation-id` and `traceparent`. Background jobs persist the same carrier under the job `trace` field and also publish `correlationId` / `traceparent` SQS message attributes.

## PII-safe logging rules

Do not log raw email content or recipient data. The shared telemetry sanitizer enforces this for structured logs and EMF fields:

- Redacted keys: `authorization`, `cookie`, `token`, `api_key`, `rawKey`, `from`, `to`, `cc`, `bcc`, `replyTo`, `subject`, `html`, `text`, `body`, `headers`, `attachments`, and content payload fields.
- Email-address-shaped strings in freeform fields are replaced with deterministic SHA-256 hashes.
- Safe identifiers such as `email_id`, `job_id`, `delivery_id`, SNS/SES message ids, status, and retry counters may be logged.
- CloudWatch metric dimensions must stay low-cardinality; never use email addresses, domains, subjects, message bodies, or arbitrary customer input as dimensions.

## CloudWatch metrics

Metrics are emitted as EMF JSON log records in the `NamuhSend` namespace by default. Override with `CLOUDWATCH_METRICS_NAMESPACE` when an environment needs a distinct namespace.

| Area | Metrics | Dimensions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API email accept | `EmailAccept`, `EmailAcceptLatency` | `Service=api`, `Operation=email.accept`, `Outcome=queued|scheduled|failed|unauthorized|invalid` |
| API batch accept | `EmailBatchAccepted`, `EmailBatchAcceptLatency`, `EmailBatchAcceptFailed` | `Service=api`, `Operation=email.batch_accept`, `Outcome=accepted|failed|unauthorized|invalid` |
| Queue publish | `QueuePublish`, `QueuePublishLatency` | `Service=api|ingester|worker`, `Operation=queue.publish`, `JobType`, `Outcome=published|skipped|failed` |
| Queue depth | `QueueDepthVisible`, `QueueDepthInFlight` | `Service=worker`, `Operation=queue.depth` |
| Worker jobs | `WorkerJobLatency`, `WorkerJobProcessed`, `WorkerFailures`, `RetryCount` | `Service=worker`, `Operation=job.process`, `JobType`, `Outcome` |
| SES send | `SendLatency`, `SendOutcome` | `Service=worker`, `Operation=ses.send`, `Outcome=sent|failed` |
| SES ingest | `SesEventIngested`, `SesEventIngestFailed` | `Service=ingester`, `Operation=ses.ingest`, `EventType`, `Outcome` |

Recommended alarms for staging/production:

- `WorkerFailures > 0` for 5 minutes.
- `SendOutcome` with `Outcome=failed` above the expected baseline.
- `QueueDepthVisible` increasing for 10 minutes while `WorkerJobProcessed` stays flat.
- `QueueDepthInFlight` near the SQS visibility/in-flight limit.
- `EmailAcceptLatency` p95 above the request-path target.

## Trace a send from API accept to provider result

1. Send an email with an explicit correlation id:

   ```bash
   curl -i -X POST "$APP_URL/api/emails" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "x-correlation-id: debug-$(date +%s)" \
     -d '{
       "from":"hello@example.com",
       "to":["recipient@example.com"],
       "subject":"Observability probe",
       "html":"<p>probe</p>"
     }'
   ```

2. Copy the response `x-correlation-id`, `traceparent`, and returned email `id`.
3. In CloudWatch Logs Insights, query the app and ingester application log groups:

   ```sql
   fields @timestamp, level, event, service, operation, correlation_id, trace_id, email_id, job_id, job_type, status, reason, duration_ms
   | filter correlation_id = "debug-..." or traceparent = "00-..." or email_id = "..."
   | sort @timestamp asc
   ```

4. Expected event sequence for an immediate send:

   ```text
   api.request.start
   email.accepted
   span.start / queue.publish
   metric.emf QueuePublish
   span.start / worker.email.send
   span.start / ses.send
   span.end / ses.send
   metric.emf SendOutcome + SendLatency
   span.end / worker.email.send
   metric.emf WorkerJobProcessed + WorkerJobLatency
   ses.event.received
   metric.emf SesEventIngested
   span.start / queue.publish (webhook.dispatch, when matching webhooks exist)
   ```

5. If the API accepted the email but no worker send appears:

   - Check `QueuePublish` for `Outcome=published` on the same `correlation_id`.
   - Check `QueueDepthVisible` and `QueueDepthInFlight`.
   - Confirm the ingester has `BACKGROUND_WORKER_POLL=true` and `BACKGROUND_JOBS_QUEUE_URL` set.
   - Tail the ingester log group described in `docs/ingester-deploy.md`.

6. If the worker failed:

   - Query for `event = "email.send.failed"` or `WorkerFailures` with the same `trace_id`.
   - Check `RetryCount`; SQS retries remain visible through receive count and redrive to the configured DLQ.
   - Inspect SES permissions, sender verification, sandbox status, and AWS service errors in the sanitized `error_name` / `error_message` fields.

## Local verification

Local logs go to stdout/stderr as JSON. With no SQS queue configured, queue publishes emit `queue.publish.skipped` and `QueuePublish` with `Outcome=skipped`, which is expected for Docker-friendly development.

Use the unit coverage for regression checks:

```bash
bun run test -- tests/observability.test.ts tests/background-jobs.test.ts tests/api-emails.test.ts tests/queue-worker.test.ts tests/ingester-ses-route.test.ts
```
