## What is Opensend?

Opensend is a **self-hostable email platform** that gives you the same developer experience as Resend — REST API, TypeScript SDK, React email templates, domain verification, webhooks, and a full dashboard — running on your own infrastructure.

**Use it if you want:**
- Full control over your email infrastructure
- No per-email pricing — send as much as your SES quota allows
- A drop-in Resend-compatible API for your existing code
- An admin dashboard for domains, templates, broadcasts, and analytics

## One-Click Deploy

The fastest way to get Opensend running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/namuh-eng/opensend.git
cd opensend
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — AWS credentials are only needed for real email sending
docker compose up -d
```

That's it. Open **http://localhost:3015** and sign in with Google (configure `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env`).

> The `migrate` service runs database migrations automatically on first boot.

## Features

- **REST API** — Send emails via a simple POST request with API key auth
- **TypeScript SDK** — [`opensend`](./packages/sdk) npm package with full type safety
- **React Email Templates** — Pass React components via the SDK's `react` prop
- **Domain Verification** — DKIM, SPF, DMARC auto-configured via Cloudflare DNS
- **API Key Management** — `full_access` and `sending_access` permission scopes
- **Broadcasts** — Block editor with slash commands, audience targeting, review panel
- **Templates** — Create, edit, publish with variable substitution (`{{name}}`)
- **Audience** — Contacts, segments, topics, custom properties
- **Webhooks** — Register endpoints for 17 event types (delivered, bounced, opened, etc.)
- **Metrics** — Delivery, open, click, bounce rates with date range filtering
- **Logs** — Full send/delivery/event audit trail
- **API Docs** — Auto-generated interactive docs at `/docs`
- **Dashboard** — 10-page admin UI with dark mode

## API Quickstart

### Send an email

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3015/api/emails \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "from": "hello@yourdomain.com",
    "to": ["recipient@example.com"],
    "subject": "Hello from Opensend",
    "html": "<h1>It works!</h1>"
  }'
```

Open `http://localhost:3015/docs` for the full local API reference.

### TypeScript SDK

```bash
bun add opensend
```

```typescript
import { Opensend } from "opensend";

const client = new Opensend("YOUR_API_KEY", {
  baseUrl: "https://your-deployment.example.com",
});

const { data } = await client.emails.send({
  from: "hello@yourdomain.com",
  to: "recipient@example.com",
  subject: "Hello from Opensend",
  html: "<h1>It works!</h1>",
});

console.log("Queued email", data?.id);
```

Full SDK docs: [`packages/sdk/README.md`](./packages/sdk/README.md)

## Self-Hosting

### Requirements

- Docker & Docker Compose
- AWS account with SES access (for sending emails)
- *(Optional)* Cloudflare account (for automatic DNS record setup)

### Docker Compose (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/namuh-eng/opensend.git
cd opensend
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your configuration:

```bash
# Required for sending emails
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-aws-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret
AWS_REGION=us-east-1

# Optional
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-db-password     # Default: opensend
POSTGRES_PORT=5432                     # Change this and DATABASE_URL together if 5432 is taken
PORT=3015                              # Default: 3015
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=your-cf-token     # For auto DNS setup
CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID=your-zone-id
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket             # For email attachments
BACKGROUND_JOBS_QUEUE_URL=...          # Optional locally; required for async production sending
BACKGROUND_WORKER_POLL=true            # Set on the ingester worker when SQS is configured
CLOUDWATCH_METRICS_NAMESPACE=Opensend  # Optional CloudWatch EMF namespace override
```

`.env.example` keeps `DATABASE_URL` on `localhost` for host-run commands like `bun run dev` and `bun run db:push`. Docker Compose injects its own internal `postgres` hostname for the containerized app and migration services.

Start everything:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts PostgreSQL, runs migrations, launches the app, and launches the standalone SES/SNS ingester on port `3016`. Open **http://localhost:3015** for the dashboard/API and `http://localhost:3016/health` for the ingester health endpoint.

### Manual Setup

If you prefer running without Docker (requires [Bun](https://bun.sh)):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/namuh-eng/opensend.git
cd opensend
bun install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — leave DATABASE_URL as localhost unless you're using another Postgres instance.
bun run db:push
bun run db:seed          # Optional: creates sample data
bun run dev              # Development (port 3015)
# or
bun run build && bun start  # Production
```

To suppress the optional GitHub star prompt during install, use `SKIP_STAR_PROMPT=1 bun install`.

### AWS SES Sandbox

New AWS accounts start in SES **sandbox mode** — emails can only be sent to verified addresses. To send to anyone:

1. Verify a sender domain in the Opensend dashboard
2. Request production access in [AWS SES Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses/) → Account dashboard → Request production access

### Production Deployment

For production, we recommend:

- **Database**: Use a managed PostgreSQL (AWS RDS, Supabase, Neon, etc.) instead of the Docker Compose Postgres
- **Reverse proxy**: Put Nginx or Caddy in front for TLS termination
- **Secrets**: Store credentials in your cloud provider's secrets manager
- **Rate limiting**: Use a shared Redis/ElastiCache instance instead of the disabled local default
- **Background jobs**: Use SQS with a redrive policy/DLQ, plus EventBridge to trigger scheduled-email and webhook retry scans
- **Observability**: Emit structured JSON logs, trace/correlation headers, and CloudWatch EMF metrics for send and worker flows

### Shared rate limiting (staging/production)

Opensend now treats API rate limiting as an explicit runtime contract:

- `RATE_LIMIT_BACKEND=disabled` skips API rate limiting entirely. This is the default for local single-process development only.
- `RATE_LIMIT_BACKEND=redis` enables the middleware-backed shared limiter. If Redis is misconfigured or unavailable, API requests fail with `503` instead of silently falling back to per-process memory.
- `REDIS_URL` must point at a TLS-enabled Redis endpoint such as `rediss://default:<password>@<primary-endpoint>:6379`.

For AWS ElastiCache, enable **in-transit encryption** on the replication group/serverless cache and use the TLS endpoint that AWS exposes. AWS documents both the `TransitEncryptionEnabled=true` requirement and TLS client connections to the primary/configuration endpoint.

### AWS-native background jobs

Email sending is queue-first: `POST /api/emails` validates and persists the email row, then publishes an `email.send` job instead of calling SES on the request path. The ingester service owns background job execution.

Configure these variables for staging/production:

- `BACKGROUND_JOBS_QUEUE_URL` — SQS queue URL used for `email.send`, `webhook.dispatch`, scheduled scan, and webhook retry scan jobs.
- `BACKGROUND_JOBS_REQUIRE_QUEUE=true` — fail API publishing if the queue URL is missing instead of silently skipping publish. Use this in staging/production.
- `BACKGROUND_JOBS_EVENT_BUS_NAME` — optional EventBridge bus for job lifecycle events/automation hooks.
- `BACKGROUND_WORKER_POLL=true` — set on the ingester service to long-poll SQS and execute jobs.
- `INGESTER_JOB_TOKEN` — optional bearer token required by ingester `/jobs/*` endpoints when EventBridge invokes them over HTTP.

Operational shape:

1. App/control plane: persist intent in Postgres as `queued`, publish SQS job, return `{ id }`.
2. Ingester/worker: long-poll SQS, execute SES sends, set `sent_at` when SES accepts the message, and delete messages only after success.
3. Scheduled sends: EventBridge should call `POST /jobs/scheduled-emails` on the ingester every minute, or publish a `scheduled-email.scan` job, to enqueue due `email.send` jobs.
4. Webhook retries: failed webhook deliveries stay `pending` with `next_retry_at`; EventBridge can call `POST /jobs/webhooks` or publish `webhook-delivery.scan` to retry due deliveries.
5. Retries/DLQ: configure the SQS queue redrive policy with a DLQ. Worker failures leave messages undeleted so SQS retry/redrive owns retry exhaustion.

Local dev remains Docker-friendly if no queue is configured: publishes are logged/skipped and API calls still persist rows. To exercise the real worker locally, set `BACKGROUND_JOBS_QUEUE_URL` and `BACKGROUND_WORKER_POLL=true` on the ingester.

### Observability

Email accept and worker flows emit structured JSON logs with `x-correlation-id`, W3C/OpenTelemetry-compatible `traceparent`, sanitized span events, and CloudWatch EMF metrics for accept latency, send outcomes, queue depth, retries, and worker failures. Set `CLOUDWATCH_METRICS_NAMESPACE` to override the default `Opensend` namespace.

See [`docs/observability.md`](docs/observability.md) for PII-safe logging rules, metric names, alarms, and the runbook for tracing an email from API acceptance to SES/provider result.

### Redis-backed auth/domain metadata cache

The same `REDIS_URL` is also used for hot-path metadata caching:

- API key auth lookups are cached by token hash for 5 minutes.
- Domain DB detail lookups are cached by domain id for 5 minutes.
- SES domain identity lookups are cached by domain name for 2 minutes.
- API key create/delete and domain create/update/delete/verify/auto-configure flows invalidate affected cache entries immediately.

Local dev stays safe if Redis is absent: requests fall back to Postgres/SES as the source of truth. In staging/production, point `REDIS_URL` at a shared TLS-enabled Redis/ElastiCache endpoint so multiple app instances see the same cache state.

Quick verification after deploy:

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:3015/api/auth/verify \
  -H 'x-forwarded-for: 203.0.113.10'
# Expect: X-RateLimit-Backend: redis when enabled
```

The included `Dockerfile` produces an optimized multi-stage build suitable for any container platform (AWS App Runner, Google Cloud Run, Fly.io, Railway, etc.):

```bash
docker build -t opensend .
docker run -p 3015:8080 --env-file .env opensend
```

For the split-service App Runner shape, SNS cutover, and ingester log/replay runbook, see [`docs/ingester-deploy.md`](docs/ingester-deploy.md).

## Development

For local contributor onboarding, use the same Docker-backed path as [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
make setup    # starts Postgres, installs deps, pushes schema, seeds DB
make dev      # http://localhost:3015
```

`make setup` uses the host-machine `DATABASE_URL` from `.env` (`localhost` by default). Docker Compose app and migration containers use their own internal `postgres` hostname automatically.
`bun install` also installs the repo's versioned Git hooks automatically by setting `core.hooksPath` to `.githooks`.

```bash
bun run hooks:install  # optional manual reinstall if you used --ignore-scripts
bun run check          # runs the same change-scoped push guardrail used on pre-push
make check             # full repo typecheck + lint
make test              # Unit tests
make test-e2e          # E2E tests (requires dev server)
make all               # Everything
```

Local guardrails:

- `pre-commit` runs Biome on staged JS/TS/JSON/CSS/Markdown files for quick feedback.
- `pre-push` runs `bun run check`, which checks only the files changed from `origin/main` and blocks the push if those changed files fail lint or typecheck.

`make check` still runs the full repo validation. The push hook stays change-scoped because the current upstream branch still has unrelated legacy lint/typecheck failures outside this PR's scope.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full development guide.
